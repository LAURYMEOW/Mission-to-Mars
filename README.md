# Mission to Mars

* The goal of this project was to improve the Robin's website in a way that makes it visually appealing and interactive.
* The hemispheres of Mars have been added as thumbnail images as well as the featured image and the app update button have been formatted.

Everything has been obtained with scraping and a template has been generated for the app to work. 

We are doing very well, we can still make some arrangements.
